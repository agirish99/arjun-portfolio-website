Automated a full UI regression suite using Selenium WebDriver, integrating with Jenkins for scheduled runs and reporting.

- Parallelized critical flows to reduce runtime and improve feedback loops.
- Stabilized flakiness via deterministic test-data seeding and robust waits.
- Documented runbooks and onboarded the team to own future tests.
